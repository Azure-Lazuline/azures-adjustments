# Azure's Adjustments

![](https://github.com/Azure-Lazuline/azures-adjustments/blob/main/screenshots/banner.png?raw=true)

A bunch of small balance changes and bugfixes for CrossCode, intended to smooth things out just a little bit. A few combat arts had their visuals improved, or their stats adjusted â€” just giving some weaker skills some help, and making the most powerful skills a little bit more conditional. (But keeping their best-case just as strong as it used to be!) Some enemies have visuals that better indicate their attacks now too, and there's some small changes to the equipment/trade interface and other miscellaneous things.

This was designed for a first playthrough in mind, but has nice additions for experienced players too.

## Detailed Changes

<details>
<summary><b>Enemies/Bosses</b></summary>

- Added timing rings to hedgehags and behesloths so you know exactly when they'll dash. Go for the perfect guard!
  
- Ectovolts have a more obvious flash before they use their melee attack.

- Fixed the erroneously swapped heat/cold weaknesses on the mecha fish enemies and boss.

- Dungeon enemies respawn much quicker after clearing the room, to help with getting materials from ones that are only in a single room. (Overworld enemies are unaffected.)

- The DLC temple midboss's phase transition attacks are in a randomized order but they're slightly easier to dodge, so it's not just a matter of memorizing where to place them.

- A certain DLC bonus boss spends *significantly* less time flying around doing nothing, and has generally improved AI with much more attack variety.

<summary><b>Combat Arts</b></summary>

- First Cut / Final Showdown: Small VFX improvements, and you're not stuck in place for as long if you whiff.

- Azure Surge: VFX improvements for a bit more punch.

- Ashen Mine / Mine Valley: Small damage boost, to match its difficulty and lack of iframes compared to the alternative skills.

- Ring of Fire (all 3): VFX improvements to all of them, and a damage boost to base Ring of Fire itself.

- Frigid Flawke: Only does the camera pan if you actually hit an enemy, to prevent jarring camera movements.

- Tesla Twist / Tesla Waltz: Small damage boost, and a little easier to control.

- Thunder Dart / Storm Walker: Slows down time during the dash, so enemies are less likely to escape it before it goes off.

- Ether Snipe: Lower damage at first, but ramps back up to its old extremely high power level as it bounces more. You gotta go for the bank shots!

- Guard Sphere: SP gain greatly reduced while it's active, so it's still powerful when used sparingly but you can't keep it up permanently.

- Clock Block / Glitch Time: SP gain moderately reduced while it's active, keeping its extreme utility and combo potential but making it not literally pay for itself anymore.

<summary><b>Other</b></summary>

- The equipment comparison menu always puts changed modifiers at the top of the list, so you don't need to expand it each time.

- Traders get added to the trader book from just passing by them rather than needing to open the trade menu.

- Traders don't reset your "compare mode" setting when switching between different items.

- The sandbag (Baggy-kun) at the First Scholars HQ gives SP when hit. What kind of guild has a non-functional training dummy?

- Pets are automatically hidden during emotional or important scenes.

- A few small typo fixes.

### Installation

To use, install [ccloader](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader), and go to the "Mods" menu ingame (the button at the *top* of the Options menu, not the tab on the right) and it should be listed there to select and install. It should automatically grab any prerequisites.

You can also install manually by placing [the .ccmod file](https://github.com/Azure-Lazuline/azures-adjustments/releases) in your ccloader mods folder, and doing the same with [extension-asset-preloader](https://github.com/elluminance/crosscode-extension-asset-preloader/releases) (a prerequisite needed to modify DLC enemies).
